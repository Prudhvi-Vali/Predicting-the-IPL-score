# Predicting-the-IPL-score<br>
The data set attached is from the kaggle.<br>
THe data cleaning, feature extraction, optimization is performed in both the ipython files.<br>
The IplScore Pridiction.ipynb looks at two algoritms Lasso and Ridge regression and their performance.<br>
The IplScore Pridiction&Comparision.ipynb looks at the algotithms Linear, Descision, Random Forest algorithms and their performance.<br>
The Linear regressor is boosted using the ADAboost to optimize the performance.
